The molecular structure of *trans*-bis(pyridin-3-yl)ethylene (**3,3′-bpe**), C~12~H~10~N~2~, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction is reported. The molecule self-assembles into two dimensional arrays by a combination of C---H⋯N hydrogen bonds and edge-to-face C---H⋯*π* interactions that stack in a herringbone arrangement perpendicular to the crystallographic *c*-axis. The supramolecular forces that direct the packing of **3,3′-bpe** as well as its packing assembly within the crystal are also compared to those observed within the structures of the other symmetrical isomers *trans*-1,2-bis(*n*-pyridyl)ethylene (***n***,***n*****′-bpe**, where *n* = *n*′ = 2 or 4).

## 1. Chemical context

Bis(pyridyl)ethylenes have arisen as somewhat of a natural extension of cinnamic acid as a series of molecules capable of undergoing \[2+2\] photodimerization in the solid state to generate cyclobutanes. Foundational work by Schmidt and coworkers on *trans*-cinnamic acids led to the formation of the \`Topochemical Postulate', which dictated that [olefins](http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04281.html) within 4.2 Å of one another are capable of undergoing the photodimerization process. Unlike cinnamic acid, which crystallizes in such a way that the [olefins](http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04281.html) are rendered photoactive (olefins within 4.2 Å of one another), the native crystalline forms of bis(pyridyl)ethylenes are photostable (olefins separated by distances \> 4.2 Å in the crystal). To achieve photoreactivity of these [olefins,](http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04281.html) it often becomes necessary to use a \`molecular template' that can interact with the olefin-containing bipyridine *via* supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, argento- and aurophilic interactions, and dative N→B interactions. Analyses of the crystal structures of symmetric bis(pyridyl)ethylenes derivatives such as the *trans*-bis(*n*-pyridyl)ethylenes series of isomers (*n* = 2, 3 or 4) is necessary to understand the forces that govern their crystallization, why they are photostable, and why use templates to achieve photoreactivity (Campillo-Alvarado *et al.*, 2019; Chanthapally *et al.*, 2014; MacGillivray *et al.*, 2008; Pahari *et al.*, 2019; Sezer *et al.*, 2017; Volodin *et al.*, 2018).

## 2. Structural commentary

The alkene **3,3′-bpe** crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic [space group](http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Space_group) *P*2~1~/*n* (Fig. 1). The [asymmetric unit](http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Asymmetric_unit) consists of one-half molecule of **3,3′-bpe** with the C=C bond sitting on a crystallographic center of inversion. The pyridyl rings adopt an *anti*-conformation with respect to each other (Fig. 1).

## 3. Supramolecular features

Adjacent **3,3′-bpe** molecules interact primarily *via* edge-to-face C---H⋯*π*\[*d*(C6⋯pyr) 3.58 Å; *Θ*(C6---H6⋯pyr) 131.8°\] forces between pyridyl rings (Fig. 2). Those rings also participate in C---H⋯N \[*d*(C4⋯N1) 3.59 Å; *Θ*(C4---H4⋯N1) 139.5°\] hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2). The forces generate nearly planar sheets (Fig. 3), which aggregate into a herringbone arrangement of adjacent sheets (Fig. 4). Nearest-neighbor alkene C=C bonds of **3,3′-bpe** between adjacent sheets reveals a parallel, but offset orientation of the neighboring [alkenes](http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00224.html) relative to one another at a distance of 5.50 Å. The distance exceeds the inter-alkene separation of Schmidt for photodimerizarion and suggests that **3,3′-bpe** is photostable (Schmidt, 1971).

## 4. Database survey

For the ***n*****,*n*′-bpe** (where: *n* = *n*′ = 2, 3, or 4) series of symmetric [alkenes,](http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00224.html) all three adopt nearly planar conformations (Table 1), with the pyridyl rings of **3,3′-bpe** and **2,2′-bpe** adopting *anti*-conformations with respect to each other. The packings of the symmetric [alkenes](http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00224.html) are defined by combinations of C---H⋯*π* and/or C---H⋯N hydrogen bonds (Table 1) to form either one-dimensional chain (**2,2′-bpe**, Fig. 5) or two-dimensional sheet (**3,3′-bpe** and **4,4′-bpe**) structures (Fig. 6). Similar to **3,3′-bpe**, the alkene C=C bonds of **2,2′-bpe** (6.09 Å; Vansant *et al.*, 1980) and **4,4′-bpe** (5.72 Å; Tinnemans *et al.*, 2018) (Table 1) are beyond the separation distance of Schmidt (1971).

## 5. Synthesis and crystallization

The alkene **3,3′-bpe** was prepared as described (Quentin *et al.*, 2020; Gordillo *et al.*, 2007, 2013) via a one-pot, aqueous Pd-catalyzed Hiyama-Heck cross-coupling between 3-bromopyridine and triethoxyvinylsilane (2:1 molar ratio) (Fig. 7). Flash [chromatography](http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01075.html) (SiO~2~, 10% MeOH/CH~2~Cl~2~) furnished **3,3′-bpe** as yellow crystals: 222.3 mg (23%). A portion of **3,3′-bpe** was dissolved in CHCl~3~ and allowed to slowly evaporate at room temperature. Single crystals in the form of colorless plates suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction formed within seven days.

## 6. Refinement

Crystal data, data collection and structure [refinement](http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Refinement) details for **3,3′-bpe** are summarized in Table 2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were located in the difference-Fourier map and freely refined with 0.93 \< C---H \< 0.99 Å. [Refinement](http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Refinement) of the hydrogen atoms led to a data-to-parameter ratio of ∼10. The single-crystal data were collected at room temperature to best reflect conditions under which photochemical reactions are typically conducted. Room-temperature data can also lead to fewer reflections and/or scaling anomalies.
