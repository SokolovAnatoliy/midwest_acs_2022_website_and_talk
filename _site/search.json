    "text": "The molecular structure of trans-bis(pyridin-3-yl)ethylene (3,3′-bpe), C12H10N2, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction is reported. The molecule self-assembles into two dimensional arrays by a combination of C—H⋯N hydrogen bonds and edge-to-face C—H⋯π interactions that stack in a herringbone arrangement perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis. The supramolecular forces that direct the packing of 3,3′-bpe as well as its packing assembly within the crystal are also compared to those observed within the structures of the other symmetrical isomers trans-1,2-bis(n-pyridyl)ethylene (n,n′-bpe, where n = n′ = 2 or 4)."

    "text": "1. Chemical context\nBis(pyridyl)ethylenes have arisen as somewhat of a natural extension of cinnamic acid as a series of molecules capable of undergoing [2+2] photodimerization in the solid state to generate cyclobutanes. Foundational work by Schmidt and coworkers on trans-cinnamic acids led to the formation of the `Topochemical Postulate’, which dictated that olefins within 4.2 Å of one another are capable of undergoing the photodimerization process. Unlike cinnamic acid, which crystallizes in such a way that the olefins are rendered photoactive (olefins within 4.2 Å of one another), the native crystalline forms of bis(pyridyl)ethylenes are photostable (olefins separated by distances > 4.2 Å in the crystal). To achieve photoreactivity of these olefins, it often becomes necessary to use a `molecular template’ that can interact with the olefin-containing bipyridine via supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, argento- and aurophilic interactions, and dative N→B interactions. Analyses of the crystal structures of symmetric bis(pyridyl)ethylenes derivatives such as the trans-bis(n-pyridyl)ethylenes series of isomers (n = 2, 3 or 4) is necessary to understand the forces that govern their crystallization, why they are photostable, and why use templates to achieve photoreactivity (Campillo-Alvarado et al., 2019; Chanthapally et al., 2014; MacGillivray et al., 2008; Pahari et al., 2019; Sezer et al., 2017; Volodin et al., 2018)."

Those rings also participate in C—H⋯N [d(C4⋯N1) 3.59 Å; Θ(C4—H4⋯N1) 139.5°] hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2). The forces generate nearly planar sheets (Fig. 3), which aggregate into a herringbone arrangement of adjacent sheets (Fig. 4). Nearest-neighbor alkene C=C bonds of 3,3′-bpe between adjacent sheets reveals a parallel, but offset orientation of the neighboring alkenes relative to one another at a distance of 5.50 Å.

We use template molecules (e.g. resorcinol) to direct the formation of covalent bonds in solids. Both hydrogen-bond and coordination-driven self-assembly are used to position olefins in multi-component assemblies in solids for [2+2] photodimerizations.\n\n\n\nOrganic semiconductors molecules (e.g. pentacene) are leading candidates in the design of flexible electronics (e.g. electronic paper). We have shown how organic semiconductors can be forced to stack into face-to-face arrangements in solids. We introduced a class of semiconductor materials known as ‘semiconductor cocrystals’ where we showed that cocrystallizations of organic semiconductors afford π-stacking arrangements. We are collaborating with Prof. Alexei Tivanski (Dept. of Chem., UI) to study the electrical properties of the semiconductor solids.\n\n\n\nThe bulk properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (i.e. drug molecule) can be altered using molecules that cocrystallize with an API to give a new solid form. We have described cocrystals involving caffeine and carboxylic acids based on competing hydrogen-bonded heteromolecular synthons. We have also described the first pharmaceutical nanococrystals and a unique role of tautomers in cocrystal design and formation.
