title: "Len MacGillivray Group Website"
---

Hello everyone. This is the internal reference website for the Leonard MacGillivray Group in the [Chemistry Department](https://chem.uiowa.edu/) at the University of Iowa.

This is a demonstration of a website built with Quarto! If everyone contributes their own work - the website will be a useful resource to the group for years to come.

It can combine R, Python and much more!

Here is an R demo.

```{{r}}
len = "Len's Group"
len %>% str_to_lower()
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
library(reticulate)
library(stringr)
len = "Len's Group"
len %>% str_to_lower()

```



Here is a python demo

```{{python}}
print(f"{r.len.lower()}")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
print(f"{r.len.lower()}")
```


Here is a flow chart of what you need to do if you are new.

```
